        <h1>Everything is as it is, because it works. (Functionality)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p> The concept of evolution must be applied to all things:<br> 
		Material particles are the way they are, because they have managed to persist over time.<br> 
		Particles, that dissolve instantly, are non-persistent, therefore not here anymore.<br> This means, that there is a <b>Functionality</b> embedded within our reality. Its rules determine the shape of the world. 
	</p>
	<p>To clarify: We look at reality as the existence of space, waves and matter across time.<br>
	   We know this one rule beforehand, which states: Everything, which fulfills a function proposed by reality, exists across an amount of time.<br>
	   Since we observe, that a thing exist, it must mean, that this thing satisfies the function for existance. <br>
	   It must also mean, that some base noise must have existed, from which something can form, which is able to fulfill the functions requirements.<br>
	   I imagine conways game of life. A field of noise is given and a set of rules is given. From this, after a short amount of time, structures emerge, which satisfy the function for existance. </p>
	<p>This means, there is an initial field of realitypixels, whichs values can flutter over time.
	   <br> In conways game, it is a two dimensional field with poss values 1 and 0 at any given time. In our reality it is a 3d space with an unknown number of otherdimensional values fixed at each point in space.</p>
	<p> Again, there must exist rules that allow the interaction of several spacepoints to merit existance over time.<br>
	 Such a thing as velocity of an object exists. Therefore in some way two points in spacetime must allow transmission of information across time.<br>
	My body exists across time. This means that a collection of spacetime pixels can be called "an object", if they fulfill some requirement.</p>
